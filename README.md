# BU-COVID project

### Overview
As with most institutions of higher learning world-wide, Boston University's goal of reopening at some appropriate level in the Fall of 2020 is accompanied by risk and uncertainty.  Throughout the early summer of 2020, we conducted a detailed modeling exercise to provide insight into the expected relative efficacy of potential interventions taken around a Fall 2020 BU re-opening.  Our approach was to do so in a manner informed as much as reasonably possible by BU data, with a focus primarily on the dynamics around (i) classroom instruction, and (ii) residential housing.  In turn, we are making available our software and model parameters, to facilitate other institutions conducting similar analyses.
