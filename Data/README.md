# Data directory structure

Data directory contains 3 subfolders:

* input
* networks
* results

*input* directory contains input files (artificial dataset) for the pipline;

*networks* directory contains network graphml files (igraph network objects). These files are created using pre-process\*.R scripts

*results* directory contains output files generated by the python scripts. These results then can be further examined by the post-processing R script.
