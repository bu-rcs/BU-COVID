# R scripts used in the pipeline

A few scripts in the pipeline are written in R. They are used to set-up input network files and to post-process the results.

* *pre-process_classroom_data.R* - Read input files describing classroom schedule and construct classroom networks
* *pre-process_house_data.R* - Read input files with housing information and construct building, floor, room, and houshold networks
